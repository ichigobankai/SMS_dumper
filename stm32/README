MD_Dumper
------------

This project is a very low cost USB Reader for Sega Megadrive Cartridge.
HID code is based on libopencm3 ARM Lib & paulfertser/stm32-tx-hid ( https://github.com/paulfertser/stm32-tx-hid)

 * Support Sega Megadrive cartridge dump ( max size is 64MB)
 * Support Read & Write save ( 8/32Kb + Bankswitch)
 * Support Sega MasterSystem/Mark3 cartridge dump ( max size is 4MB)

This firmware is targetting the cheapest STM32F103 board as found in
numerous listings on eBay and Aliexpress (might have the following
keywords: ARM STM32F103C8T6 Minimum System Development Board Module
For Arduino).

* Board description
The board has an STM32F103C8T6 controller for USB communication ( SEGA Cart <> PC) & 5V IO
It uses three 74LS273 for multiplexing IO DATA lines into 22 address lines.
Theorical max size is 128MB but Megadrive max without bankswitch is 64 MB.
I use 5V Tolerant pin for DATA and other for extra pins ( Backup Memory Control / Bankswitch / SMS PIN)

Finally you could also use the official ( or the Tototek) SMS/Mark3 Adaptater for Dumping SMS Cartridge

* Building the firmware
After cloning the repository "git submodule init; git submodule
update" needs to be run once, then "build.sh" to build everything
necessary.

It is assumed that "arm-none-eabi" toolchain is available in PATH,
"GCC ARM Embedded" is the recommended option. In case you need to
specify a path, CROSS_COMPILE make variable should be set
appropriately.

* Initial flashing procedure
There're two ways of flashing a blank board: via SWD and via serial
bootloader. For the first method a suitable debug adapter is needed
(e.g. ST-Link or J-Link), for the second one can use just about any
USB-UART bridge (the only requirement that is a bit unusual is to
support "even" parity).

The image to be flashed is "megadrive-hid-bootldr-combined.bin", it
contains both a DFU-compliant bootloader and the main firmware.
